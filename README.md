# Simple dasboard to visualize your data

A well designed Dashbord system using React.js and material UI for frontend and Node.js (Express.js) and MySQL for backend.

## get started

First setup your MySQL server by initializing dotenv file with the given reference in reference.txt

Then go to project directory and run:

```
$ cd server
$ npm run nodemon
```

i'll recommend you to open seperate terminal for client folder and server folder.
as per recommendation, in new terminal in the same directory run:

```
$ cd client
$ npm start
```
